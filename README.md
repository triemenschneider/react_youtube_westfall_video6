This repository contains a small react-application I created while following a nice Youtube-Tutorial/-Playlist, which is this one: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMve8qV_h5E8YuaoKG34145IuLRatslPU

This little project contains a couple of topics I want to get more familiar with:
* webpack
* react
* es6
* babel

In order to be able to go back to the code and also to learn better to handle remote git-repositories I thought it makes sense to put it here.
